# Types of metrics

1. **Series Metrics:** Data trends or comparisons, visualized as pie, bar, horizontal bar, line charts, or tables.
1. **Number Metrics:** Single values with optional targets, shown as gauges or simple numbers.
1. **Comparison Metrics:** Compare two numbers, highlighting improvements or decrements.

## Series
Series metrics involve a sequence of data points collected over a period or categorically. This type allows for detailed analysis and visualization of trends, changes, and progressions in your data. For example, tracking monthly visitors over a year.
